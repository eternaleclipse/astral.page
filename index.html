    <div class="e-content article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>Last night I played with NixOS (huge thanks to my friend <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tzlil.net/">Tzlil</a> for the recommendation!) and I had so much fun! It’s a Linux distro, somewhat similar to Arch Linux in terms of minimalist philosophy but with emphasis on reproducibility.</p>
<p>Keep in mind I’m still a newbie so there is a lot I might be missing in this post! Be sure to check out the (unofficial, community-maintained) <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://nixos.wiki/">NixOS Wiki</a>.</p>
<h3 id="Reproducibility"><a href="#Reproducibility" class="headerlink" title="Reproducibility"></a>Reproducibility</h3><p>This basically means that anything you install is automatically added to your nix file(s). You can easily control your entire system configuration - bootloader, partition layout, wpa_supplicant, packages, user profiles, services, environment, software-specific configuration, <strong>Everything</strong> can be declared in the Nix config files. They freakin’ support stuff like chromium &#x2F; firefox profiles and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://search.nixos.org/options?channel=unstable&show=programs.chromium.extensions&from=0&size=50&sort=relevance&type=packages&query=programs.chromium">extensions</a>, oh-my-zsh theme, <code>.vimrc</code> options, you name it.</p>
<p>These config files can be backed up in a git repository that you can easily deploy whenever you need to restore, clone or modify your system.</p>
<h3 id="Installation"><a href="#Installation" class="headerlink" title="Installation"></a>Installation</h3><p>Installation is super straightforward for what you’d usually expect from this type of minimalistic OS. There is a friendly GUI that lets you pick which type of Desktop Environment you want (if any) and the usual stuff (region, user &#x2F; pass).</p>
<p><img src="/images/nixos-installer.png"></p>
<p>I chose GNOME as my Desktop Environment. After the setup finished, I was greeted by this beautiful screen:</p>
<p><img src="/images/nixos-installed.png"></p>
<p>The disk usage for the default GNOME installation is just shy of 9 GB.</p>

<h3 id="Enabling-experimental-Nix-features"><a href="#Enabling-experimental-Nix-features" class="headerlink" title="Enabling experimental Nix features"></a>Enabling experimental Nix features</h3><p><strong>Nix</strong> is NixOS’s package manager, it uses it’s own expression-based pure-functional language, “Nix”, to define the logic that decides which packages are installed. The first thing we wanna do is go ahead and enable “experimental” Nix features. This gives us access to stuff like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes">Flakes</a> which are the new way of creating and managing packages.</p>
<h3 id="Trying-out-packages-temporarily"><a href="#Trying-out-packages-temporarily" class="headerlink" title="Trying out packages temporarily"></a>Trying out packages temporarily</h3><p>If we just wanna play with a package, we can have it downloaded and run temporarily.<br>When the command completes, the package will disappear from our system!</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">[user@nixos:~]$ echo 123 | nix run nixpkgs#ripgrep 123</span><br><span class="line">123</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">[user@nixos:~]$ rg</span><br><span class="line">rg: command not found</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<h3 id="nix-shell"><a href="#nix-shell" class="headerlink" title="nix-shell"></a>nix-shell</h3><p>Using the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://nixos.org/manual/nix/stable/command-ref/nix-shell.html">nix-shell</a> command, we can create a temporary, isolated shell environment where we can temporarily play with a package.</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br><span class="line">14</span><br><span class="line">15</span><br><span class="line">16</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">[user@nixos:~]$ nix-shell -p wget</span><br><span class="line">this path will be fetched (0.62 MiB download, 3.25 MiB unpacked):</span><br><span class="line">  /nix/store/biaz74lcslins8c0kl5pv3yzxp1b02qj-wget-1.21.3</span><br><span class="line">copying path &#x27;/nix/store/biaz74lcslins8c0kl5pv3yzxp1b02qj-wget-1.21.3&#x27; from &#x27;https://cache.nixos.org&#x27;...</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">[nix-shell:~]$ wget</span><br><span class="line">wget: missing URL</span><br><span class="line">Usage: wget [OPTION]...

<p>You can also use <code>nix-shell</code> with some Nix scripting to make <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Development_environment_with_nix-shell">your own isolated development environment</a>. How cool is that!</p>
<h3 id="Installing-packages-persistently"><a href="#Installing-packages-persistently" class="headerlink" title="Installing packages persistently"></a>Installing packages persistently</h3><p>I’m feeling like typing stuff, so let’s install Vim!<br>To add a package persistently, we can edit our <code>/etc/nixos/configuration.nix</code> and add it here:</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [</span><br><span class="line">  # Existing packages...</span><br><span class="line">  vim</span><br><span class="line">];</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>Then, we need to run <code>sudo nixos-rebuild switch</code> and it applies our new configuration, installing the package.</p>
<p>Alternatively, we can simply run <code>sudo nix-env -iA nixos.vim</code>.<br>It actually does the same thing behind the scenes - it changes the <code>configuration.nix</code> file.</p>
<h3 id="Why-this-excites-me"><a href="#Why-this-excites-me" class="headerlink" title="Why this excites me"></a>Why this excites me</h3><p>I have a problem with system bloat.<br>It’s not so much that I mind some of my disk being consumed by gigabytes of pointless cyber-garbage.</p>
<p>It’s more about the fact that you’re constantly afraid to change things, because systems become slow and break over time. Sure, there are backups, but is everything really guaranteed to be there and work correctly when something breaks? This has a terrible consequence - You don’t experiment on your host environment, and you don’t improve. You don’t even know what your system is running under the hood because you’re too afraid to look down there! So, how does it do you any good to have your OS entirely open-source if you never change anything because you’re afraid to break stuff? </p>
<p>Having the entire setup configuration declared in a bunch of files in a git repo just frees me to try crazy stuff, experiment! Try a new WM, mess with the configs, change the kernel! This is the true spirit of open source. If anything ever breaks, slows down or even gets compromised, I just copy over a bunch of files and do a <code>sudo nixos-rebuild switch</code>, and if I really mess up, I could always reinstall NixOS and apply the configuration, or even <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Creating_a_NixOS_live_CD">create an installation ISO based on my config files</a> to get everything back and working.</p>
<p>If you like a certain setup, you could easily clone it to another PC, or even share it with friends. You could have an entire organizational network definition, including desktops, servers, routers all declared in a central repository, and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://nixops.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview.html">deploy</a> them with a single command, or even have them <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Netboot">PXE boot from network</a> and install a fresh config. This level of control and transparency makes maintenance, upgrades, security and life in general so much simpler and more fun.</p>

        <blockquote><p>Men think themselves just like the Gods,<br>and so, the world is theirs alone;<br>and all its life, and all its love,<br>are simple things, to steal and own.</p>
<p>And when the world is dead and gone,<br>they look above, with hungry eyes;<br>that ancient cloak of boundless dark,<br>they claim with bloody, warring cries.</p>
<p>Each Moon and Sun, they overturn,<br>and in their greed, they tear, and maim,<br>until there is nothing left of<br>that tapestry they wished to tame.</p>
<p>But we, the ones they leave behind,<br>we look above and wish to fly.<br>But where to go, into that night,<br>after we kiss the stars goodbye?</p>

        <p>Sometimes, there is a need to put everything else aside and become hyper-focused on some task. Knowing that, we subconsciously try to hold the state of the things we left, keeping track of everything in our mind. The problem with this is that human memory is not always reliable… We can easily forget important details or lose track of progress, especially when the task at hand is complex or spans across months. So, it’s crucial to have systems in place for saving state.</p>
<p>By using external systems (such as todo lists, note-taking apps, documentation, blog posts), we create tangible representations of our work. These external representations serve as reminders or cues that bridge the gap between our internal mental state and the external world, acting as a form of persistent memory for our ideas and projects, and allowing us to remember and pick up where we left off after our focus has temporarily shifted away to something else.</p>
<p>Using external systems also reduces mental load and stress. When we rely solely on our memory to keep track of everything, it creates a constant background worry that we might forget something important. This mental burden hinders our ability to concentrate fully on the current task and can we can easily become overwhelmed by trying to keep everything in sight.</p>
<p>Documenting progress also provides a valuable resource for reflection. When you write down your thoughts, actions, and state, you create a record that can be peacefully reviewed and analyzed at a later time. This practice of reflection allows you to gain insights, recognize patterns, learn from your experiences, and make informed and better decisions in the future.</p>
<p>Part of my motivation for writing this blog is to apply this idea to my own self-development. Some of the insights I’ve learned have taken time, energy and experience to gain, and apart from sharing them with others, I want to treasure them safely in this sanctuary of ideas, to form a persistent, personal timeline that I could look back and reflect upon, in years and even decades from now.</p>
<p>Here’s to a future of exploration, joy, growth and fulfillment.<br>May our external systems continue to support our endeavors and serve as a testament to our achievements!</p>

        <p>I have always enjoyed exploring and being in nature - from walking on the seashore and swimming, to trails in forests, lakes, mountains, caves. Being away from technology and people, losing sense of time as my mind and body synergize with nature, appreciating the beauty of plants, wildlife and the vast landscapes. Something I’ve suspected for a while is that apart from the joy and excitement I gain from the experience, there are healing properties to this activity. Well, it turns out there’s decades of research to back it up - Spending time in nature positively affects overall happiness, stress levels, and equally importantly - mental fatigue, concentration, and creativity.</p>
<p>The main psychological theory that explores this was proposed in the 1980s by Stephen Kaplan and Rachel Kaplan, and is called <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_restoration_theory">Attention Restoration Theory</a>. According to the theory, our attention is divided into two types:</p>
<p><strong>Directed attention</strong>: The conscious effort we exert when we focus on specific tasks, such as studying or working.<br><strong>Involuntary attention</strong>: Effortless and occurs when we are drawn to stimuli in the environment, such as a beautiful landscape or a chirping bird.</p>
<p>Directed attention is a finite resource that can become depleted after prolonged use. When we constantly engage in tasks that require directed attention, like working in a busy office or studying in a noisy environment, our capacity to produce directed attention depletes, and we experience mental fatigue, reduced productivity, and increased stress.</p>
<p>Being in nature induces involuntary attention. This is basically like charging your directed attention batteries, restoring your attention and capacity to focus. A central part in the explanation of why this works is the concept of “Soft fascination” - a state of attention that is captured effortlessly, allowing the mind to relax and recover. The natural world provides gentle and intriguing stimulations, such as the sound of flowing water or the rustling of leaves, which attract the mind’s involuntary attention without requiring effort or cognitive processing. The resulting effect allows our capacity for directed attention to replenish, restoring our cognitive resources and ability to concentrate and engage in tasks that require prolonged focus.</p>

        <p>Recently, during dealing with some health issues of a family member, I’ve had time to think about the impermanent nature of life. How everything we worry about is so temporary and insignificant in the end. It sounds negative and sad, but how freeing is it! If only we could accept this idea and remind ourselves in our daily lives. Life is too sweet and short to be taken for granted, wasted on others’ perceptions and expectations. It is our own fears that are holding us back from realizing our potential and to truly shine.</p>
<p>I’ve long been interested in what Buddhism has to say about this topic. In Buddhism, the Dhamma (Teachings of the Buddha) has a concept called “Three Marks of Existence”.</p>
<p><strong>Anicca</strong> (Impermanence): All things are impermanent - Things, people, feelings, ideas. They all arise, exist for a period of time, and then pass away.<br><strong>Dukka</strong> (Suffering, Dissatisfaction): There is inherent suffering or dissatisfaction experienced in life due to the impermanent nature of existence. It can arise from various sources, including craving, attachment, and inability to accept change.<br><strong>Anatta</strong> (“Non-self”): The “self” as a consistent entity is an illusion. There is no unchanging essence or quality within individuals.</p>
<p>The concept of Anatta is closely tied to the attainment of <strong>Nirvana</strong> (“Enlightenment”). By recognizing the absence of a fixed self, one can free themselves from attachment, craving, and the causes of suffering, ultimately leading to the experience of Nirvana.</p>

        <p>When not learning or creating, there is a passive way to “prime” your brain. I’ve learned this technique from a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://youtu.be/A2sS00egAzg?t=330">video</a> by Elizabeth Filips. She talks in-depth about the challenges of a chaotic mind to improve in a world where consistency is key. The method she describes is interesting: instead of trying to get consistent, linear, “1% every day” progress, go for 5000% progress. The way she approaches it is by “priming” the mind. When you want to learn something, watch videos and tutorials about it, read blog posts, read about previous efforts in the field but <strong>don’t</strong> allow yourself to start actually learning it. Motivation will naturally build up, and at some point your mind won’t be able to stand it anymore - you’ll enter flow state and spend countless hours, staying up nights learning and playing with everything about this subject.</p>
<p>I know this exposure motivation method works, because I have seen it’s effects on myself in the past. Will doing this by intention lead to different results? Maybe the mind will be able to distinguish and rebel when it recognizes that it is being led or manipulated to be excited about a particular subject? I wonder.</p>

        <p>The amount of rush I get when I am already in flow and coding is unreal. In this alternate realm, the ego is dissolved, there is no concept of effort and anything is possible.

        <p>You know the feeling where there is an annoying noise in the background? Your mind readjusts to it’s new reality and accepts it as the new norm: Reality + “Beeeeeep”…</p>
<p>You’re still able to concentrate because the human brain is among the most remarkable devices to ever exist, but there is a thread running in the back of your mind, noticing the noise, processing it, and it’s taking up CPU and driving you crazy. It’s hard to even notice that it’s doing that, until the noise is gone and you relax in a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>When the noise comes back for the second time around, your mind loses faith in the idea that the environment is safe from noise, and readjusts again. As the noise keeps coming back again and again, it becomes a permanent resident in the mind’s model of the environment. Even when it disappears, you ask yourself, “Is it still there? When will it be back? Should I concentrate fully or expect the noise to come back?”. Apart from it being a nasty form of torture and taking up permanent CPU, it degrades the quality of your focus and your ability to consume informations and solve problems. You forget how it was before, and it seems like it was always like this.</p>
<p>Even when it’s not there for days, you still wait for it in anticipation, knowing it will come back to disturb you. Just like when it first introduced itself, when the noise disappears, it takes time for the mind to unlearn the trauma and gain trust in the environment as being safe from noise again. During that time, the mind had already allocated cognitive resources, using them to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.choosingtherapy.com/anticipatory-anxiety/">anticipate</a> and expect something that will break the stream of focus. So, even when the disturbance is not physically present anymore, it’s there - like a ghosting effect.</p>
<p>This phenomena happens with other types of distractions. It could be a noisy roommate or neighbor, unimportant phone call, even that other task you keep thinking about and getting back to. We basically train our mind to acknowledge that our time working is worth as much as the time spent doing the interrupting activity. Because, after all, if what we were doing was really <strong>that</strong> important, couldn’t everything else wait? This thought corrupts our mindset and stops us from letting go of outside reality and entering a state of deep work.</p>
<p>I don’t have all the answers, but for me, the way to deal with this is: instead of dealing with, or, removing the distractions, I remove myself from the distractions. Like starting with a blank sheet of paper, a separate, clean physical and virtual environment helps me completely focus and immerse myself in the process of creation.</p>

        <p>It took me far too long to realize this one, but it seems like the mind is like a plant… Do not let it’s silence misguide you, it has access to all the information about your intentions. It <strong>feels</strong> when you’re genuinely interesting in something, and when you’re bluffing, lying to yourself because there’s some arbitrary deadline for a generic test that some pile of carbon molecules wrote…</p>
<p>If you pour a bucket of water over a plant, it won’t magically grow and become 10 times bigger. The mind thrives in environments where it’s externally stimulated and it can interact and play with things, like a kid - to ask questions, solve mysteries, explore, make stuff happen!</p>
<p>The way I phrase work in my mind before I approach it, whether in a specific session or in general, can affect my productivity by hundreds of percents. It’s a relatively elusive matter, because the moment I think of it in these terms, measuring and optimizing performance, the magic disappears. I find it’s best to just be present in the flow, immerse yourself in the rhythm and let the mind take over.</p>
<h3 id="The-inner-child-learns-and-creates-through-playing"><a href="#The-inner-child-learns-and-creates-through-playing" class="headerlink" title="The inner child learns and creates through playing"></a>The inner child learns and creates through playing</h3><p>A while ago, I’ve started working through a wonderful book that takes you through a psychological journey to reconnect with your inner child through art and dialogue. This quote particularily resonated with the idea of freeing your mind to learn by playing, messing around and having fun.</p>
<blockquote><p>“It is a well-known fact that children develop and learn through play. While playing they explore, test their limits, and develop skills. Allowed to play without pressure and criticism, children’s true creativity blossoms from within. Watch any group of nursery school kids or kindergartners. Left to their own devices they will play with finger paints and clay, scribble with crayons, erect entire cities with building blocks, create magical castles and landscapes in the sandbox, and invent their own world through dramatic play with costumes and props.</p>
<p>Metaphors are natural to children. They adore make-believe. The youngest children create scenarios and act them out. They can turn anything into a prop. A broom handle becomes a sword. A garbage can lid becomes a shield, and a packing crate becomes a fort. No one has to teach children the fun of creative play. It is an intrinsic human ability that shows itself best in the child. On the contrary, society teaches children to stop being creative, to grow up, and to be “practical.” If the Inner Child is to be fully reclaimed, this innate creativity must be allowed to express itself. This creative aspect of the Inner Child is often called the Magical Child”.</p>
