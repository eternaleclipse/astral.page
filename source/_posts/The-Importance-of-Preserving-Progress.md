Sometimes, there is a need to put everything else aside and become hyper-focused on some task. Knowing that, we subconsciously try to hold the state of the things we left, keeping track of everything in our mind. The problem with this is that human memory is not always reliable... We can easily forget important details or lose track of progress, especially when the task at hand is complex or spans across months. So, it's crucial to have systems in place for saving state.

By using external systems (such as todo lists, note-taking apps, documentation, blog posts), we create tangible representations of our work. These external representations serve as reminders or cues that bridge the gap between our internal mental state and the external world, acting as a form of persistent memory for our ideas and projects, and allowing us to remember and pick up where we left off after our focus has temporarily shifted away to something else.

Using external systems also reduces mental load and stress. When we rely solely on our memory to keep track of everything, it creates a constant background worry that we might forget something important. This mental burden hinders our ability to concentrate fully on the current task and can we can easily become overwhelmed by trying to keep everything in sight.

Documenting progress also provides a valuable resource for reflection. When you write down your thoughts, actions, and state, you create a record that can be peacefully reviewed and analyzed at a later time. This practice of reflection allows you to gain insights, recognize patterns, learn from your experiences, and make informed and better decisions in the future.

Part of my motivation for writing this blog is to apply this idea to my own self-development. Some of the insights I've learned have taken time, energy and experience to gain, and apart from sharing them with others, I want to treasure them safely in this sanctuary of ideas, to form a persistent, personal timeline that I could look back and reflect upon, in years and even decades from now.

Here's to a future of exploration, joy, growth and fulfillment.
May our external systems continue to support our endeavors and serve as a testament to our achievements!
