I have always enjoyed exploring and being in nature - from walking on the seashore and swimming, to trails in forests, lakes, mountains, caves. Being away from technology and people, losing sense of time as my mind and body synergize with nature, appreciating the beauty of plants, wildlife and the vast landscapes. Something I've suspected for a while is that apart from the joy and excitement I gain from the experience, there are healing properties to this activity. Well, it turns out there's decades of research to back it up - Spending time in nature positively affects overall happiness, stress levels, and equally importantly - mental fatigue, concentration, and creativity.

The main psychological theory that explores this was proposed in the 1980s by Stephen Kaplan and Rachel Kaplan, and is called [Attention Restoration Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_restoration_theory). According to the theory, our attention is divided into two types:

**Directed attention**: The conscious effort we exert when we focus on specific tasks, such as studying or working.
**Involuntary attention**: Effortless and occurs when we are drawn to stimuli in the environment, such as a beautiful landscape or a chirping bird.

Directed attention is a finite resource that can become depleted after prolonged use. When we constantly engage in tasks that require directed attention, like working in a busy office or studying in a noisy environment, our capacity to produce directed attention depletes, and we experience mental fatigue, reduced productivity, and increased stress.

Being in nature induces involuntary attention. This is basically like charging your directed attention batteries, restoring your attention and capacity to focus. A central part in the explanation of why this works is the concept of "Soft fascination" - a state of attention that is captured effortlessly, allowing the mind to relax and recover. The natural world provides gentle and intriguing stimulations, such as the sound of flowing water or the rustling of leaves, which attract the mind's involuntary attention without requiring effort or cognitive processing. The resulting effect allows our capacity for directed attention to replenish, restoring our cognitive resources and ability to concentrate and engage in tasks that require prolonged focus.
