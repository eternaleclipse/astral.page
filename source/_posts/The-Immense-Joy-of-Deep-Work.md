The amount of rush I get when I am already in flow and coding is unreal. In this alternate realm, the ego is dissolved, there is no concept of effort and anything is possible. The mind is [flying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8DkZqQ8yHQ) in 3000mph, completely free from anything that ever held it back. It doesn't take too much time to get there, either. I just need to get over the 10 minutes of "getting bored" and recalibrate the "focus lenses" of my mind to zoom in on the thing I want.
