### Time needed
20-30 minutes.

### Ingredients
- Broccoli (1 bag, 800g)
- Coconut cream, 1 can (500ml)
- Eggs, 3
- Salt, to taste
- Pepper, to taste
- Curry powder, start with 1-2 tsp. and adjust to your preference

### Instructions

**For the coconut curry cream**
1. Pour the coconut milk into a saucepan over medium heat.
2. Add 1-2 teaspoons of curry powder into the saucepan and stir well to combine with the curry powder.
3. Bring the mixture to a simmer and let it cook for about 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the sauce thickens slightly and the flavors meld together.
4. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Adjust the amount of curry powder if desired.
5. Remove the coconut curry cream from the heat and set it aside.

**For the broccoli**
1. Wash the broccoli thoroughly and cut it into florets. Peel and chop the stalks into small pieces if desired.
2. In a separate large pan or skillet, heat some oil over medium heat.
3. Add the broccoli florets and stalks to the pan and sauté for about 5 minutes until they start to become tender. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
4. Reduce the heat to low and cover the pan. Let the broccoli cook for another 5-10 minutes, or until it reaches your desired tenderness, stirring occasionally.
5. In a separate bowl, whisk the eggs together.
6. Temporarily remove the cover, push the sautéed broccoli to one side of the pan and pour the whisked eggs onto the other side. Allow the eggs to cook for a minute or two until they start to set.
7. Gently scramble the eggs with a spatula or fork, breaking them into smaller pieces.
8. Once the eggs are cooked, mix them with the sautéed broccoli in the pan.
9. Once the broccoli is cooked, remove it from the heat.

**To serve**

1. Place the cooked broccoli on a serving plate or individual bowls.
2. Pour the coconut curry cream over the broccoli or serve it on the side as a dipping sauce.
3. Serve hot.

Enjoy!
