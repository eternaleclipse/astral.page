In the modern era, technological and societal advancements have given us the means to live lives that our ancestors could only dream of. We have access to superpowers that the even royalty did not possess - Internet (greatest network of knowledge in history), instant worldwide communication, global travel, healthcare (along with [absurdly long lifespans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_expectancy#Variation_over_time)!).

As it turns out, despite these incredible advancements, many individuals struggle to harness the full potential of these tools in their lives. Instead of embracing the opportunities that the modern age offers, they find themselves turning to non-constructive patterns of thinking and behaving. The advancements have also come with their own set of mental chains, traps and barriers [[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_overload)] [[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_paralysis)] [[3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_burnout)] [[4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfectionism_(psychology))] [[5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_of_negative_evaluation)] [[6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_of_missing_out)] [[7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome)] [[8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance)] [[9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxic_positivity)] [[10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_comparison_theory)] [[11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynicism_(contemporary))] [[12](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_nihilism)].

To rise above, we must make conscious choices to embrace the opportunities given to us, and decide what we can leave out. By treating our minds and lives as the precious gifts they are, we can begin to live life fully, taking charge of our learning, health, relationships, time, purpose. The power is in our hands to elevate ourselves beyond these challenges and create a life of significance, to awaken to the potential that lies within us.

It may not always be easy but there are vast amounts of resources out there for achieving virtually any dream or mission that the human mind aspires to.

Let us heed to the call of the unknown... Greatness awaits.
