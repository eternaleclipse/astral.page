Recently, during dealing with some health issues of a family member, I've had time to think about the impermanent nature of life. How everything we worry about is so temporary and insignificant in the end. It sounds negative and sad, but how freeing is it! If only we could accept this idea and remind ourselves in our daily lives. Life is too sweet and short to be taken for granted, wasted on others' perceptions and expectations. It is our own fears that are holding us back from realizing our potential and to truly shine.

I've long been interested in what Buddhism has to say about this topic. In Buddhism, the Dhamma (Teachings of the Buddha) has a concept called "Three Marks of Existence".

**Annica** (Impermanence): All things are impermanent - Things, people, feelings, ideas. They all arise, exist for a period of time, and then pass away. 
**Dukka** (Suffering, Dissatisfaction): There is inherent suffering or dissatisfaction experienced in life due to the impermanent nature of existence. It can arise from various sources, including craving, attachment, and inability to accept change.
**Anatta** ("Non-self"): The "self" as a consistent entity is an illusion. There is no unchanging essence or quality within individuals.

The concept of Anatta is closely tied to the attainment of **Nirvana** ("Enlightenment"). By recognizing the absence of a fixed self, one can free themselves from attachment, craving, and the causes of suffering, ultimately leading to the experience of Nirvana.
