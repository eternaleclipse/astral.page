When not learning or creating, there is a passive way to "prime" your brain. I've learned this technique from a [video](https://youtu.be/A2sS00egAzg?t=330) by Elizabeth Filips. She talks in-depth about the challenges of a chaotic mind to improve in a world where consistency is key. The method she describes is interesting: instead of trying to get consistent, linear, "1% every day" progress, go for 5000% progress. The way she approaches it is by "priming" the mind. When you want to learn something, watch videos and tutorials about it, read blog posts, read about previous efforts in the field but **don't** allow yourself to start actually learning it. Motivation will naturally build up, and at some point your mind won't be able to stand it anymore - you'll enter flow state and spend countless hours, staying up nights learning and playing with everything about this subject.

I know this exposure motivation method works, because I have seen it's effects on myself in the past. Will doing this by intention lead to different results? Maybe the mind will be able to distinguish and rebel when it recognizes that it is being led or manipulated to be excited about a particular subject? I wonder.
