{% blockquote %}
Men think themselves just like the Gods,
and so, the world is theirs alone;
and all its life, and all its love,
are simple things, to steal and own.

And when the world is dead and gone,
they look above, with hungry eyes;
that ancient cloak of boundless dark,
they claim with bloody, warring cries.

Each Moon and Sun, they overturn,
and in their greed, they tear, and maim,
until there is nothing left of
that tapestry they wished to tame.

But we, the ones they leave behind,
we look above and wish to fly.
But where to go, into that night,
after we kiss the stars goodbye?
