It took me far too long to realize this one, but it seems like the mind is like a plant... Do not let it's silence misguide you, it has access to all the information about your intentions. It **feels** when you're genuinely interesting in something, and when you're bluffing, lying to yourself because there's some arbitrary deadline for a generic test that some pile of carbon molecules wrote...

If you pour a bucket of water over a plant, it won't magically grow and become 10 times bigger. The mind thrives in environments where it's externally stimulated and it can interact and play with things, like a kid - to ask questions, solve mysteries, explore, make stuff happen!

The way I phrase work in my mind before I approach it, whether in a specific session or in general, can affect my productivity by hundreds of percents. It's a relatively elusive matter, because the moment I think of it in these terms, measuring and optimizing performance, the magic disappears. I find it's best to just be present in the flow, immerse yourself in the rhythm and let the mind take over.
